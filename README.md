## Introduction of The Data

In this project we will be compiling together some messy real-world data, and then designing an analysis to answer a research question. 

Regarding this project, we will analyze four datasets (Datasets: trends_up_to_....csv, Most+Recent+Cohorts+(Scorecard+Elements).csv, CollegeScorecardDataDictionary-09-08-2015.csv, id_name_link.csv) A university in the United States was chosen from the files created using Google Trends. Used the College Scorecard's basic dataset, which offers a wealth of information about US universities and the people who graduate from them. We'll utilize those data to link colleges indicated in the Scorecard data with colleges identified in the Google Trends data, in particular.

## The Analysis

The College Scorecard isn’t just data for us - it’s also treatment! The College Scorecard is a public-facing website that contains important information about colleges, including how much its graduates earn. This information has traditionally been very difficult to find.

## RESEARCH QUESTION:

The College Scorecard was released at the start of September 2015. Among colleges that predominantly grant bachelor’s degrees, did the release of the Scorecard shift student interest to high-earnings colleges relative to low-earnings ones (as proxied by Google searches for keywords associated with those colleges)?
